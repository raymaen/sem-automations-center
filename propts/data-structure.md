Google Ads Sheet Structure

The app will follow the same structure that Google Ads Editor expects for RSA imports, minus headline/description pinning. This ensures exports are always valid and upload smoothly.

In Display Table: The preview table will use the same column structure as the Google Ads sheet, so users can visually confirm the final layout. Columns include:

Campaign

Ad group

Final URL

Path 1

Path 2

Headline 1 … Headline 15

Description 1 … Description 4

In Output CSV: The exported CSV will use exactly the same headers and order. Example header row:

Campaign,Ad group,Final URL,Path 1,Path 2,Headline 1,Headline 2,Headline 3,Headline 4,Headline 5,Headline 6,Headline 7,Headline 8,Headline 9,Headline 10,Headline 11,Headline 12,Headline 13,Headline 14,Headline 15,Description 1,Description 2,Description 3,Description 4

This dual approach means what users see in the preview table matches what they’ll download and import into Google Ads Editor.
