# Responsive Search Ads (RSA) Builder Guide

Responsive Search Ads (RSAs) allow Google’s machine learning to mix and match different headlines and descriptions to show the best ad for each search query. They are the default search ad type and can deliver 5–15% higher CTR compared to standard ads.  
This guide explains how to use the RSA Builder app effectively, step by step, while following best practices.

## 1. Campaign Settings
Here you set the foundation for your ads.

- **Campaign Name**: Pick something descriptive (e.g. “Air Duct Cleaning Missouri – Discovery”).  
- **Base Domain / Final URL**: Always send users to a **relevant service page**, not your homepage.  
- **Tag (Optional)**: Use to track internally.  
- **Descriptions (up to 4)**:  
  - Each can be 90 characters max.  
  - Provide at least 2 unique descriptions.  
  - Highlight benefits, trust, offers, or pricing.  
  - Avoid repeating headlines.  

💡 *Tip: Use Display Paths (Path 1, Path 2) to reinforce offers or locations (e.g. `/free-quote`, `/kansas`).*

## 2. Headline Banks
This is where you create your pool of headlines, grouped by type.

**Categories**  
- **Benefit** → Customer outcomes (e.g. “Cleaner Air in 2 Hours”).  
- **Offer** → Prices/deals (e.g. “$99 Air Duct Cleaning”).  
- **Feature** → Service details (e.g. “Family-Owned, Free Inspection”).  
- **Trust / Authority** → Social proof (e.g. “5 Star Rated With 500+ Reviews”).  
- **CTA** → Direct actions (e.g. “Call Now for a Free Quote”).  
- **Utility** → Ad group-specific (installation, repair, location).  

**Best Practices**  
- Aim for **10–15 unique headlines**.  
- Keep each headline **≤30 characters**.  
- Use **different angles** (don’t repeat wording).  
- Include keywords in some, but not all, headlines.  
- Vary length to let Google test short vs long assets.  
- **Connected Variants**: Place multiple variations on one line separated by a semicolon `;`.  
  - Example: `Lowest Prices; We Offer the Lowest Prices`.  
  - The app ensures they rotate across ads, never together.

## 3. Ad Groups
Organize your assets into groups with specific targeting.

- **Group Name**: Example: “Air Duct Installation”.  
- **Final URL**: Landing page specific to this group.  
- **Custom Headlines**: Add group-specific lines (e.g. “Expert Duct Installation”).  
- **Number of Ads**: Usually 2 per group (up to 3).  
- **Utility Headlines Allocation**: Choose how many slots (0–3) to fill with group-specific lines.  

💡 *Tip: Keep baseline headlines consistent across groups, then add a few custom ones for each service variation.*

## 4. Preview & Export
Review before launching.

- The **preview table** shows each RSA as it will export to Google Ads Editor.  
- Columns include Campaign, Ad Group, Final URL, Paths, Headline 1–15, and Description 1–4.  
- Errors/warnings highlight duplicates or over-limit characters.  
- Export generates a **CSV** ready to import into Google Ads Editor.

## RSA Best Practices Recap
- **Quantity**: Give Google more options (aim for 15 headlines + 4 descriptions).  
- **Diversity**: Don’t repeat the same phrasing. Cover offers, benefits, trust, features, CTAs.  
- **Keyword Use**: Match user intent in some headlines, but not all.  
- **Pinning**: Use sparingly. If you pin, provide multiple options per pinned slot (H1, H2, H3).  
- **Extensions**: Add sitelinks, callouts, promotions, and other assets in Google Ads for higher Ad Rank.  
- **Monitor & Iterate**: After launch, check the **Asset Report** to see which headlines and descriptions perform best. Refine over time.
